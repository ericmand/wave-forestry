title: Screening Assesment
---

## Audience

The screening and assessment section of the toolkit is targeted towards replicators that
have established criteria for their candidates. These replicators are interested in candidates
that meet their eligibility requirement. The main priority is to ensure the candidates that
eventually make it through the program are those that possess the required competencies
for the program. This section is also valuable for replicators that are interested in learning
methods of screening and assessing candidates for a program.

## Definition

Screening is the process of evaluating whether someone is the right candidate for a specific
job based on set eligibility criteria. In this context, screening is used to identify candidates
that are the right fit for the training program. These criteria are often created by the
organization based on its program’s objectives and requirements.
Assessment is defined as the evaluation or estimation of the nature, quality, or ability of
someone or something. In order to evaluate an ability, assessment tools in the form of a
standardized test is used to collect data for a specific skill e.g. writing, communication,
critical thinking.
Screening & Assessment

## Outcomes

This section of the toolkit will provide you with the tools and resources that will enable you
to:
- Understand and apply the principles driving WAVE’s screening & assessment
- Design a screening and assessment protocol which enables your organization to
efficiently and effectively assess and admit candidates into your programs

## Why It’s important

The second step in the WAVE process is screening and assessment. The objective of the
screening process is to eliminate candidates that do not meet the organization’s criteria and
for candidates to opt out of the program. The screening process includes an information
session, assessment, and admissions. A dedicated Outreach and Admissions team carries
out this process.

The process of screening and assessing candidates has many benefits including reducing
overall program cost as the organization avoids spending resources on people that do not
fit. It also increases participation and uptake of the program, and enables a better training
experience for all stakeholders. In addition, by assessing a candidate before training, you
are validating the skills which are required in order to succeed within the program.

## Principles

### Utilize assessment tools to screen for essential requirements

To ensure the candidates have the required foundational skills, administer assessments to
test for the skills (and skills levels) your organization has identified as foundational. The
foundational skills are skills that are essential for a job. They can be identified in partnership
with your EPs, and can include skills that candidates can be trained in and skills you do not
train for. For example, your organization likely does not train candidates to be literate in
English; however, if English literacy is a requirement, a test can be used to determine a
candidate’s proficiency. Assessment tools enable you to make the recruiting process
objective and also give the participant the confidence that their performance is the only
deciding factor.
WAVE has a 3-step screening process which helps the organization make an objective and
informed decision on who will be admitted into the program. There is a classroom
simulation, an online assessment, and an interview. The online assessment consists of 40
short questions to determine the candidate’s ability to speak, read and write in English
(official language of the training program), desperation to secure a job, motivation,
interpersonal skills, problem solving and basic mathematics skills. A candidate’s
performance on each step advances them to the next. The online assessment was created
by WAVE and screens for indicators which WAVE has identified as attributes required to
succeed on the job

:::note Principle in Action!
Below are some sample questions found in WAVE’s online assessment test. These questions tes for different indicators and/or skills that WAVE has identified as important.

1. You find out there is a job where you will earn N35,000 a month but you have to
wake up at 4am six days a week for the job. How likely are you to take this job?

    a) Very likely
    b) Somewhat likely
    c) Somewhat unlikely
    d) Definitely not

2. Describe a challenge you faced and how you overcame it.
*Testing for writing skills*

3. You live in town A and don’t have the transport fare to attend an interview tomorrow in town B
which is 2 hours away. Your friend said she would loan you money, and so you've confirmed your
interview with the company But she just got back to you and said she couldn't give you the money.
What do you do? *Testing problem solving abilities*

    c. 880
    d. 1000
    e. 780

:::note Principle in Action!
Create interview questions and interview assessment rubric before interviewing candidates. Below are sample questions used by WAVE.
It is important to have a list of interview questions that test for criteria the organization is testing for.
WAVE tests and assesses across 6 indicators:
 - desperation (desire),
 - fit/Interest in WAVE,
 - motivation,
 - problem solving,
 - interpersonal skills,
 - ability to learn.
These indicators are identical to what is tested in the online/written assessment.
1. If you work in the front desk of a store and your manager suddenly assigns you to clean the
guest toilets for one week every month, what would you do?
*Testing candidates’ desire for a job*
2. What do you know/have you heard about WAVE and what we do?
*Testing candidates’ Fit/interest in WAVE*
3. Tell me about a time when you experienced a challenge
*Testing candidates’ motivation*
4. "You are a front desk associate at a hotel. It’s 9pm and a man and his family arrive at the hotel
from the airport to check in. They present their reservation confirmation showing that they have
paid for a room for 3 nights. However, when you check your system, you are unable to find their
names under guest reservations. Your manager has been away all day and you have been
unable to reach him via phone, SMS or email. The hotel is completely booked and there are no
available rooms. What do you do?”
*Testing problem solving abilities*
5. Please tell me about a time when you had a conflict with an authority figure and how you
resolved it.
*Testing interpersonal skills*
6. What were your West African Examinations Council (WAEC) marks?
*Testing for ability to learn*

### Give candidates an opportunity to self-select themselves into the program.

Not all eligible candidates would be fit for the program. It is important for candidates to
assess if the program is a right fit for them based on the information provided. The
screening process should also enable the potential candidates who meet the eligibility
criteria to screen themselves into or out of the program. This requires providing all the
necessary information about the program including time commitment and financial
requirements. By self screening, recruited candidates are able to take a realistic stock of
their life priorities as well as the program requirements and make a decision. Self screening
results in a more dedicated candidate pool. In addition, it has the potential to save your
organization money if candidates self-select early instead of dropping out during the training
the organization when you have already invested time and resources into them.
As part of the admissions process, WAVE holds an information session aimed at providing
additional information about its program to the youth recruited during the outreach phase.
The aim of the information session is to provide more detailed information about the
program in order for the organization to sell recruits on the benefits and to give them an
opportunity to make an informed decision. There is a Q & A session which focuses on
answering the questions and concerns of the recruited youth. Being transparent, managing
expectations, giving accurate information and answering all questions truthfully enables a
candidate to decide if the program is the right fit for him/her. In addition, potential
candidates are asked specific questions in order to select themselves into the program.

:::note Principle in Action!
Ask the following questions during information session in order to encourage potential candidates to
self-select themselves into the program. It is important to tailor the questions based on the details of
your program. Example if your program is 4 weeks, ask if youth can commit to 4 weeks of training.
Raise your hand if your answer is yes to these questions. Ask each candidate one at a time.
Candidates that answer YES to all 4 questions are ready to begin the process.
1. Are you able to complete the X-week training?
2. Are you interested in a job that pays an average of N25,000 per month? (NOTE: Change naira amount based on the average wage in the selected industry)
3. Are you interested in an entry job in retail and hospitality (kitchen assistant, waiter,
housekeeper, sales associate? (NOTE: Change jobs based on the industries you are training
for)
4. Are you willing to work in one job for up to a year?

## The WAVE Way

Wave Screening/Admissions Process:
- Hold an Information Session. Executing an information session
- During session ask candidates self selection questions

If the answer is a “Yes” to each of the questions, then the candidates are willing to
continue with the process. A candidate that is not willing to put in 100% will not benefit
from your services.
- Invite candidates that meet criteria to fill a candidate application form
- Administer assessment exams (written or online).
- Grade Assessments (50% and above pass mark)
- Send SMS to candidates that passed the assessment for an in-person interview
- Hold interviews for candidates. (70% pass mark). Use an interview assessment rubric to
standardize and score candidates. Note: 

Individual organizations determine their own
pass marks, and the mark can change over time based on the cadre of candidates
recruited.
- Provide candidate admissions letter to candidates that pass.
- Admitted candidate fills bio-data form.
- Input results into candidate management database and screening & assessment metric
tracking dashboard.
- Analyze Data in order to improve processes and for reporting purposes.

## Lessons Learned/Tips
- An effective self screening method enables candidates go through the screening stage
over two days in order to think through the process and self-reflect.
- Irrespective of how well you screen, some people will drop out at different stages of the
process, hence it is important to recruit (2-3 times) more people than required for
enrollment.
- Screening can be done efficiently without actual in-person interviews. Online
assessments can be used as an effective tool.
