title: About the Toolkit
---

## Objective

The objective of the toolkit is to provide an easy to use DDT guide for organizations
interested in replicating the WAVE model. The toolkit provides an overview of the principles
that guide WAVE in its youth centered DDT. Replicating organizations can use the toolkit to
replicate part(s) of our processes that are applicable to them, or the entire process, in order
to improve in their services to youth.

## Methodology

The toolkit was developed through a collaborative effort with key team members of various
teams within WAVE. A thorough review of all WAVE assets was carried out, in addition to
in-depth interviews which focused on “what”, “why” and “how” in each activity or policy. By
focusing on the what, why, and how, users of the toolkit can integrate WAVE’s principles
and processes into their work while understanding the rationale behind each activity.

## Audience

The toolkit can be a valuable resource to a wide range of organizations and institutions. An
organization that focuses on up-skilling young Africans would find the toolkit beneficial, as it
would help equip the organization with valuable tools and resources to prepare the youth for
gainful employment. A secondary school teacher can use the toolkit to help develop 21st
century life skills that will help their students become “ready for work.” The toolkit will help
recruitment agencies become more effective at identifying employable individuals and
ultimately matching those individuals to the appropriate jobs. Similarly, non-profit
organizations and private sector businesses can benefit from the toolkit by identifying the
skills required for employees to add value to their organizations in order to bring such
employees into their organization, or up-skill existing employees.

## Toolkit Structure

The toolkit is divided into two primary sections - Designing a Demand-Driven program and
Implementing a Demand-Driven program. Each section and sub section provides an
overview of the intended audience, outcomes, definition of the process, why it is important,
WAVE’s guiding principles, the WAVE Way (Step-by-Step WAVE process), supporting
tools for implementer, lessons learned/tips from WAVE team members and ways in which
WAVE can provide additional support at various levels to users of the toolkit.
