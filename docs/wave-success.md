title: WAVE Success
---

To date, WAVE has trained over 3,000 youth directly through its academies, and over
7,000 youth have been trained through our replicating partners. In the last 5 years, we have
worked with 250 businesses across various industries in Nigeria and placed over 1,450 in
jobs.

Successful job placements have also translated to income transformation for our alumni. In
2017, alumni reported an average pre-WAVE salary of NGN13,000 and post WAVE salary
of around NGN 50,000, a 285% increase within a year of graduation. Similar results have
been reported by alumni with longer post WAVE experience

Employer Partners (EP) have reported great satisfaction with the WAVE process and the
skill set of our alumni with many being repeat customers that use WAVE for human capacity
needs within their businesses. The success of the WAVE model has led to an increase in
replicators who want to incorporate our principles into their models, and businesses that
have contracted WAVE to deliver customized programs for their work force in order to build
their capabilities.

## Alumni: Omotola Adebanji
*BOARDED FOUR BUSES TO THE TRAINING CENTRE*

Omotola rounded off her secondary school education at the Solpabag
Royal College, Oko. As a result-driven individual, she was eager to
discover her potential and apply herself to work.

Omotola was unemployed when she heard about WAVE from a good friend of hers and
decided to give it a try. She decided to enroll to learn soft skills and be well equipped on
"how to succeed during an interview session."

While at WAVE, Omotola was introduced to skills such as teamwork, good and effective
communication, and time management. The major challenge she had during the training
was the distance. She spent NGN2,000 a day on transportation, and boarded four buses
just to get to the training centre. Omotola almost gave up but was motivated by her NYSC
batch-mates who supported her financially up until graduation day.

While at WAVE, she got the opportunity to job shadow at Kuddy Cosmetics as a
storekeeper. Her primarily responsibility was to monitor keep track of store inventory, sort
our expired inventory, and attend to customers.
Upon graduation from WAVE, she secured a job at Adeysoile, a fashion brand in Lekki as
the Personal Assistant to the Chief Executive Officer of the company. The job has exposed
her to the fashion industry.

Omotola dreams of owning a fashion-related business in order to support and fight the
unemployment issue in Nigeria. Now that she works in a reputable organization, she
supports her family and caters for her mum’s well being.

Her advice to job-seekers is “always believe in yourself, don’t ever think you can’t make it
and never look down on yourself.

## Alumni: Sulaimon Mustapha (Batch 42)
*I WAS ONCE ON THE STREET, SEEKING A JOB*

Sulaimon is a secondary school graduate from Isah Williams High School,
Iponri. He is self-motivated and committed to learning soft skills, after
being on the street, hustling.

Having worked as a cashier at KC Gym Limited and as a sales attendant at Royal Philip Trading
Company, Mustapha made us understand the road to success is no joke. Mustapha was
introduced to WAVE by an alumnus, Taiwo Ogooluwa. 

Mustapha’s decision to get trained on soft
skills, and also be connected to a job within the retail and/or hospitality industry made him apply
for the program. His expectation to join the program was to get a job and this changed while on
the training. Thus, he saw the training as a medium to perform professionally on the job and also
develop himself personally. The major challenge he had doing the training was to wake up early,
which was unusual for him. He had to apply the skill of time-management to arrive at the training
on-time. He boarded two buses to and fro daily from Makoko to the training at Yaba.

Mustapha found the training both educative and exciting because he was newly exposed to
teamwork, time-management, problem-solving, effective communication, emotional intelligence
and Microsoft excel learning.

Upon completing the training, he job-shadowed at an accounting firm, Itunu Rewane and Co., as
a consultant, where he was introduced to payroll and PAYE tax. His dream job is to be an
accountant in a big, well-structured organization. 

Mustapha has taken a step to arrive at the
dream job by enrolling for ICAN.

Currently, Sulaimon Mustapha works as an audit trainee at Itunu Rewane and Co, where he
job-shadowed. He has been able to learn more on the job, most especially things related to
auditing and taxation.

Sulaimon Mustapha supports his family financially in his own little way and his advice to
unemployed youth is: “never to give up and always believe in God and make sure you go through
WAVE training so as to be fully prepared for the workplace.”
