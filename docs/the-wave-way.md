## 1. Define Target Population

The first step in designing any program is to appropriately define your target population in
order to ensure that all subsequent decisions are made with the group in mind. Target
population refers to the group or type of people with shared characteristics an organization
plans to serve. Often, the target population is defined in your organization’s mission and
vision.

## 2. Labour Market Research
The next step in creating a demand-driven program is conducting research on the labour
market in your community. The essence of a demand-driven program is to ensure that your
program is meeting the human resource needs of EPs within your target community, and
training youth to align their skill sets with those needs. Demand-driven programs should not
be created without the engagement of EPs. Your targeted geography, organization’s
resources and its human capacity will drive the scope of your labour market research. In
addition, your research should be driven by key questions you seek to answer. During
WAVE’s inception stage, the primary question was “What are the high-growth industries in
Nigeria that could absorb thousands of less educated (uncredentialed) youth?What are the
top employers in those industries?”

Depending on your community, secondary data is often available by way of labour market
reports, which can provide you with an overview of the high growth industries within your
community. With this information, the next step is to drill down further to research top
companies that are hiring and ask targeted questions. However, if your organization is
located in a relatively small region or market, with limited market data, your organization will
have to conduct primary research to understand the labour market.

How to Conduct Labour Market Research (small region/community)
- Design labour market research survey questions
- Build a database of industries/sectors within your community (retail, hospitality,
consumer goods, social sector, light manufacturing, construction, etc)
- Research different organizations within your community. Note: leverage online
job portals, newspaper adverts, government reports.
- Identify and select potential target organizations. The number depends on
available resources
- Establish contact with organizations, seek for interview with HR manager
and/or CEO
- Discuss/Interview key contact focusing on answering research questions
- Compile and analyze responses
- Verify conclusions with employers

## 3. Building Employer Organization Partnerships

After concluding your research and identifying key sectors, the next step is to focus on
building relationships with the EPs you met at the research stage. Building lasting,
long-term relationships will enable your organization to meet its objectives faster and will be
beneficial to all stakeholders.

### Steps in building partnerships
- Establish your partnership goals. It is important to know what you want to
achieve from a partner, while being flexible and creative. Your partnership
goals may vary with the different employers you select to approach. Example
goals: I want to secure this employer as a contributor to curriculum
development. I want to secure this partner to be an off-taker (employer) of
youth my organization trains.
o Identify/outline your organization’s value proposition. Develop a
presentation about your organization and what it can offer to different partners.
The presentation should include relevant information about your organization,
such as its mission, vision, services and value proposition. Ensure the value
proposition is aligned with the established goals.
- Make contact with selected organization. For maximum impact and
efficiency, select businesses that you engaged during the Labour Market
Research as you already have a relationship with them.
- Introduce your organization, its services and value proposition.
- Follow up with partner on agreed next steps. Following up ensures that you
are continuously engaged with your partners and keeping your end of the
bargain.

## 4. Design your training curriculum
Designing a curriculum for your program has several components, ranging from training
goals to training evaluation. It is a comprehensive, detailed and thorough exercise. Often,
organizations utilize third party service providers as consultants to design and create their
curriculum. When designing a curriculum, it is important to invoke all four principles to
ensure you have a curriculum that is activity based, focused on the outcomes of the learner,
and receives the expert input and stamp of approval from EPs.

ADDIE is a common instructional systems design (ISD) model used by instructional
designers and training developers. The five phases—Analysis, Design, Development,
Implementation, and Evaluation—are guidelines for building effective training and
performance support tools. Replicators can use the ADDIE model to build their curriculums.


### Needs Assessment

For a demand-driven program, the needs assessment must take into
consideration the perspective of the two main stakeholders - the EP and the candidates (or
employees). The information gathered from the Labour Market Research can double as the
needs assessment for the employers. The report should provide an overview of the skills
and competencies that employers/market require. The employers may provide a list of skills
and competencies and it is necessary for the organization to decide which skills it has the
resources and capacity (financial and human) to train young people in. It is also necessary
to conduct a needs assessment of the target audience, i.e. the youth. The assessment
should focus on the gap between the skills and knowledge the trainees have and what
employers require. The outcome of the need assessments should be a list of skills and
competencies the training plans to address.

### Design

The design phase of the process provides a framework for your training. This
phase focuses on the structure of your training program, the knowledge, skills and
competencies that participants need to acquire from the training program. It also includes
the instructional objectives, outcomes, delivery methods, time allocation and assessment
tools. In summary it gives you an outline of what your program would look like. Replicators
should involve both EPs and a sample set from the identified target audience in the design
phase to ensure alignment in identified skills and competencies.

### Development

The development phase focuses on building the assets - content,
presentations, lesson exercises, assessment rubrics, and materials required for the training.
This stage is the core of your program and requires you to engage with partners in the
revision stages to ensure the overall curriculum is aligned with their requirements and
transferring the outlined skills in an effective manner.
It is highly recommended that you have a conversation with partners to ensure the content is
aligned with their needs. Hold a few revision sessions to finalize the content before general
implementation.

### Implementation

Implementation of the training is where all elements of the analyses,
design and development phases come together. Implementation is important because it is
when the instructor and the content come in contact with the target audience with the aim of
producing the learning outcomes. This phase focuses on the delivery and teaching of the
content and requires facilitators that are prepared and have the ability to engage a diverse
range of trainees

### Evaluation

Evaluation is a key aspect of the process and should be embedded at every
stage of the training, not just at the end. Once the curriculum has been created, the first
evaluation should be conducted to ensure the content and activities will enable participants
to obtain the specified outcomes. Assessments should be created for the training delivery
component of the program to ensure daily understanding of topics as well as how these
topics fit into the overall program objectives. Evaluations should be structured to ensure that
they always align with the outcome. WAVE utilizes “exit ticket questions” to test daily
understanding of concepts. It also uses baseline, midline and end-line assessments.

## 5. Training-Employment Connection

A demand-driven program aims to place every youth trained into paying jobs. However, the
reality is that there may not be enough paying vacancies to meet these goals. As an
organization, it is important to create useful training-job linkages as alumni wait for a
placement. At WAVE, the following connections are utilized to provide useful job
experience that enable a trainee to build upon their skills set, the competencies learned
from the training, as well as increase their general job experience.

### Job Shadow
Job shadow is an in-office experience that enables alumni to explore a
specific career of interest by observing a professional in that field perform their work duties
at their place of employment. The experience provides some realistic career information
that will aid the trainee in making career choices. In addition, it helps the individual develop
their confidence, awareness, and prepare to take on a role similar to the one that they have
shadowed. Job shadows are typically unpaid though most employers are willing to provide
a daily transportation stipend to subsidize the participation costs borne by trainees.

Many organizations use job shadowing as an effective tool for training new entrants/hires
and building up the capacity of existing employees by having them codify and teach their
processes to others. It is also increasingly used as a tool to vet the competencies and "fit"
of prospective hires. As a replicator, job shadowing becomes a way to complement
classroom learning as aspiring employees get to experience firsthand how to apply skills
learned in the classroom on the job. They also get to assess their own job role preferences
based on their firsthand experience of the shadowed role. It also serves as a recruitment
pathway with top-performing trainees getting offered fulltime roles in many cases.
At WAVE each trainee is linked to a job shadow assignment in the key industries WAVE
trains for, i.e. retail and hospitality. This assignment usually occurs in the third and final
week of training.

### How to create job shadow program/opportunities for candidates

1. Establish your goals for the job shadow program.
2. Ensure there is at least one week of job shadow opportunities within program design. Job
shadow opportunity should be in the industries you train for. Labour market research will
reveal the relevant industry.
3. During Labour market research, confirm if organizations will be interested in your
organization’s job shadow program.
4. During follow up meetings, make the case for the benefits of job shadowing for both EPs
and candidates in order to register organizations for the program. Note: This is an
ongoing process as your organization builds relationships with new EPs.
5. Compose and send letters to organizations that express interest in your job shadow
program in order to secure their commitment.
6. Create process of matching candidates to job shadow opportunities. Note: matching
process should be based on a candidate’s interest, their competencies, and
competencies required for the job.
7. Create a job shadow manual to brief candidates on expectations, and to reflect on and
track progress.
8. Create a job shadow assessment tool which will be used to obtain both candidate and
EP’s feedback
9. Provide opportunity for candidates to reflect publically on job placement i.e. formal
presentation to class, poster presentation.

### Internships

An internship is often an unpaid job that provides alumni with some work
experience. It is typically broader than a job shadow opportunity because the alumni is
usually given some responsibilities and gets more involved in the activities of the
organization.

### Part-time work.

Alumni can be employed within your organization on a part-time basis,
similar to an internship, to help support operations. Within this capacity, the trainee can
perform meaningful tasks that help reinforce the concepts at the training in addition to
providing immediate feedback.

### Self-employment
Self-employment is working for one’s self. While alumni wait to be
placed, the program should encourage self-employment as an option. This is possible by
helping alumni identify and define their skill sets and how they can be translated to a
service, which can be rendered for pay.

### Self-placement
While the organization aims to place alumni in paying jobs, the alumni
should be his or her own primary job placement advocate. As a result, the program should
have sessions focused on teaching alumni how to secure jobs for themselves. This often
requires digital literacy skills, ability to create a reliable online profile, ability to cold call and
seek for job vacancies in and around the community.
