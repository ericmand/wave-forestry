title: Training Delivery
---

## Audience
This section of the toolkit is targeted towards organizations that focus on delivering soft and
hard skills training to youth. Replicators interested in this section have a desire to learn
about the training facilitation methods and pedagogical approaches that WAVE utilizes in its
academies, and the driving principles behind those methods. Replicators are interested in
the quality and overall training experience for the trainees, and not simply the number of
trainees that graduate the program.

## Definition

Training is defined as the action of teaching a person a particular skill or type of behavior.
A trainer is a person in charge of administering and delivering the training.
The method and manner in which a trainer uses to pass on knowledge to the trainee is
known as the instructional design

## Outcomes

This section of the toolkit will provide you with the tools and resources that will enable you
to:
- Understand and apply the principles behind WAVE’s training curriculum during the
delivery of training
- Identify methods of training delivery that will keep trainees engaged while increasing
retention of information
- Explain different learning theories that help trainees learn

## Why It’s Important

At the core of the WAVE model is the training curriculum and how its instructors deliver it to
its trainees. The act of teaching or training involves two primary stakeholders– the trainer
and the trainee. The manner in which knowledge is shared and disseminated is important
as it determines if trainees will be able to meet the expected outcomes.

The WAVE pedagogy is based on an experiential learning approach that aims to make the
learning experience as applicable and relevant as possible to the life and workplace of
trainees. WAVE does not want to prepare its trainees for standardized, theoretical exams,
nor does it believe that there is one single set of factual knowledge that will fundamentally
address youth unemployment.

## Principles
### Tell me, I forget; show me, I remember; involve me, I understand.
This adage is the foundational principle of WAVE’s training, and sets the tone for the entire
program and how WAVE relates with its trainees throughout their association with the
organization. At WAVE, the goal of the training is not to merely have trainees go through
the training program, earn certificates, and report increasing output numbers, but rather to
have trainees go through the program having gained a deeper understanding of new
concepts and skills with the ability to apply them in both their personal and professional
lives.

With this in mind, the WAVE training is heavily reliant on involving trainees in order to
ensure that they are experiencing concepts as opposed to just being taught those concepts.

At WAVE, 10% of the training is instruction, 70% experiential and 20% review time.
 - Instruction. Detailed information telling how something should be done, operated.
 - Experiential learning is the process of learning through experience, and is more specifically defined as "learning through reflection on doing. Experiential education first immerses learners in an experience and then encourages reflection about the experience to develop new skills, new attitudes, or new ways of thinking.
 - Review. Formally going over the content and ideas generated during the training. The objective is to ensure understanding of key concepts introduced during the training session

WAVE wants its trainees to grow into self-motivated individuals, willing to learn on the job
and equipped with important mental tools and skills to solve problems and communicate
professionally. The curriculum aims to enable trainees experience and remember such
skills through practical application, case studies, teamwork exercises, peer feedback,
individual learning logbooks, repetition and guest speakers such as alumni who succeeded
professionally while embracing the WAVE values and skills.

One way WAVE ensures trainees learn key concepts by experience is by integrating the
experience in non-traditional ways. For example, in order to teach the concept of money
management, time management, budgeting and negotiation skills, rather than only
providing classroom instructions on the topic, we provide groups of trainees a
predetermined amount of money and ask each team to use the funds to provide lunch for
their fellow trainees for the day. Trainees are put into a real world situation and asked to
apply the skill. After the activity, trainees are encouraged to share their thoughts on the
experience and provide feedback. The feedback is done with the larger group and
individually within personal log books. Active involvement and self reflection are part of the
WAVE training culture and is highly encouraged. We believe this is the best way for
trainees to learn and apply skills and more broadly, to learn how to learn, retain knowledge,
and get the most out of the program.

:::note Principle in Action!
Here are steps in designing/implementing experiential activities:
1. Identify which parts of your curriculum will benefit from experiential learning (Ex: Negotiation
Module)
2. Think of problems you want trainees to solve, the objectives and outcomes of the module (How
to use communication, problem solving methods, creativity as tools for negotiations)
3. Think of what activities will help bring out the identified “problem” (Purchasing lunch for the team
with a set budget).
4. Identify relevant and thought provoking questions which trainees can use to reflect on their
experience post activity. Reflection can be done as a group, individually in log books etc.
5. Identify concepts that are relevant to the subject in order to explain experience and ideas
generated from reflection (Game Theory, Stages of Negotiations, BATNA, Non-Verbal
Communication)
6. Implement the above experiential learning cycle in class ensuring trainees participate in step 4 - active experimentation how to connect new learning in other situations and experiences.
 - 1. Concrete Experience (Doing/Having an experience)
 - 2. Reflective Observation (Reviewing/Reflecting on this
experience)
 - 3. Abstract Conceptualisation (Concluding/Learning from the
experience, synthesizing new knowledge and perspectives)
 - 4. Active Experimentation (Planning/Trying out what you have
learned in future scenarios)

### Always focus on the learners (learner centered instruction)

Learner or student centered instruction is a training approach that puts the learner’s
perspective, as opposed to the instructor’s, at the center of the training. Similar to the
curriculum design phase, within a learner centered framework, delivering the training must
take the trainees into consideration and keep their needs at the center by actively engaging
them with content, encouraging inquiry and reflection while facilitating discussions as
opposed to one-directional instructions. This is all done with the aim of getting the trainees
to take ownership of their learning, think critically about the topic at hand and how it
relates to their lives, while providing them with the maximum opportunity to learn.

AT WAVE, when delivering training, we ensure that the trainee is at the center as this
creates a better experience. The instructor is focused on what the trainees need to know in
order to be successful in the workplace. Trainees are asked questions and encouraged to
participate. When questions are asked, they are often open-ended questions in order to
provide an opportunity to go beyond yes or no answers. Trainees are engaged, excited and
doing most of the talking.

:::note Principle in Action!
Below are different methods to help create a learner centered classroom
- Arrange classroom in a manner that allows for collaboration amongst fellow trainees – avoid setting up seats in
rows, lecture style facing the instructor as this puts the instructor at the center. Have the trainees sit in a
U-shaped seating configuration. This takes away undue attention from the trainer as the expert and sends cues
to learners that learning can be drawn from anyone. Instructor should move around the classroom so they are “a
guide on the side” rather than a “sage on the stage”

- Take time to get to know your trainees and their employment journeys.
- Involve trainees in establishing the classroom rules and expectations.
- Ask open ended questions to facilitate discussions – encourage sharing of ideas and opinions.
- Facilitator should respectfully listen to all ideas, even if contrary. Always inquire about “WHY”.
- Ask exit questions at the end of the day to gain immediate feedback and to serve as content
review for the trainees.
- Ensure trainees reflect on the day’s learning in their Trainee Logbook on the day. This
encourages active learning and accountability to the learning process.

### Repetition is the mother of skills.

To develop any skills and/or to learn a new concept, repetition is required. New learning has
to be repeated and reinforced for it to be truly remembered and understood. This principle is
relatively straightforward and one that is applicable in our lives, outside of formal training
programs. Think back to when you were learning to ride a bicycle, or learning geometry. In
order to fully gain the skills and knowledge, practice in the form of repetition was the norm.
Young children learned to ride their bicycles first within their compounds with no cars, then
slowly graduate to the streets (cars around with adult supervision) and then
perhaps around the neighbourhood on their own. They were provided with different
conditions where they could master the skills of riding their bikes.

At WAVE, the concepts and skills taught do not merely present themselves in the titled
module but rather throughout the program. This is done not only to impress the importance
of the concept but also for the trainees to experience the concept in different situations. The WAVE curriculum has a dedicated problem-solving module; however, trainees learn the
concept of problem solving in other modules and activities. For example, on the first day
of training ,trainees are given a challenge to solve with teammates. This activity requires
using principles of problem solving. As the program progresses, trainees are required to
provide lunch for their fellow trainees. This activity is not part of any module, and on the
surface does not appear to be part of the formal training; however, concepts learned in the
problem solving module are required to accomplish the task. WAVE has intentionally
ensured that key concepts are repeated and experienced in different ways to help trainees
with the learning process.

:::note Principle in Action!
Tips on how to repeat key concepts in training curriculum
It is the facilitator’s responsibility to guide learning. As a facilitator, always seek out opportunities for
trainees to draw upon previous learning, and actively encourage trainees to apply new learning.
- Review concepts in different formats to ensure multiple levels of exposure.
- Hold review activities at the beginning and end of the day.
- Space out the repetition of concepts/skills in order to improve learning and retention of
information.

### Continuous and real time feedback helps trainees monitor their progress.
During the training, it is important to provide real time feedback in order to help trainees
gauge their understanding of the concepts and the skills being taught. In addition,
constructive feedback helps trainees improve their performance. However, feedback should
be multi-directional: from trainer to trainee, trainee to trainer, and trainee to fellow trainee.

It is important that all stakeholders are being evaluated not for the purpose of passing a test
but rather to learn and improve. When providing feedback, it should be specific, timely, and
relevant to the subject at hand and delivered in a manner that is focused on improvement
as opposed to criticism. Empowering trainees with the ability to give and receive positive
and negative feedback is an important aspect of training delivery.

:::note Principle in Action!
Feedback can be provided using the sandwich feedback technique (Positive - Constructive
Feedback- Positive). With this technique, the person providing the feedback provides constructive feedback between two instances of positive performances.

**P** – Positive. At first, you recognize something positive. This can be, for example, someone’s
presence, the fact that you enjoyed working with them, or that a contribution that you genuinely
appreciated.

**C** – Constructive feedback. You then suggest something that the person can improve, something
that hasn’t gone well, or another way in which a problem could have been solved, or any other form
of constructive feedback.

**P** – Positive. You finish feedback with another positive remark.

## The WAVE Way
A typical WAVE training is 3-weeks long from 8am – 6pm. A day usually consists of 5 to 7
classes. A class can be just one activity or a set of activities. Apart from the activities, each
class is typically structured as follows:
1. Trainer gives an overview of the lesson plan for the module
2. Content matter expert/trainer facilitates the class starting with an activity and follows
the module’s lesson plan.
3. Towards the end, the trainer makes sure the core knowledge and/or skills are
reiterated in a repetition phase.
4. Learning outcomes from the class are assessed in a diagnosis, reflection and
feedback phase. Repetition, diagnosis and reflection can either be separate
processes or happen at the same time. For example, a group feedback session can
be a way to diagnose and repeat what the trainees have aken away from the class,
while it is also a way to reflect and provide feedback.
5. Trainer administers exit questions.
6. Trainer ensure trainees reflect on the new learning using their logbooks. They are
prompted by questions: “one thing I took away”, “one thing I still don’t understand”
and “one thing I’d like to know/understand more about.” These reflections are
submitted and reviewed to find common themes which guide the trainer in the review
session the following day or at the end of the training week.

## Implementation Tools
- Exit Ticket Questions (WAVE Sample)
- Lesson Plan (WAVE Sample)
- Sandwich Feedback Technique
- Trainee Logbook/Feedback
- Training Structure

## Lessons Learned/Tips
- Treat trainees with respect.
- Seek to understand why a participant may be a distraction. Do not dismiss them, rather
try to understand the underlying issue.
- Facilitators should challenge the learners to answer their own questions by redirecting
the questions back to them.
- Facilitators hold multiple roles - counselor, role model, mentor, friend, and disciplinarian.
- Participants come from different backgrounds and these backgrounds can influence their
ability to apply the skills they learn in training. Encourage them to go out of their comfort
zones (family, friends or colleagues) to practice what they have learnt in class.
- Trainees do not all learn at the same pace. Encourage peer to peer learning by pairing
trainees with each other.
- Incorporate role playing or job shadowing as a means of reinforcing the class teaching.
This is often a better measure of how a participant is likely to apply the knowledge
gained outside of class.
