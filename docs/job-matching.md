title: Job Matching
---

## Audience

This section of the toolkit is targeted towards organizations that are interested in matching
candidates to available vacancies. Organizations that will find this section beneficial are
organizations that are committed to not just placing candidates in any available jobs, but
also focused on ensuring there is afit based on individual competencies and competencies
required by the job. These organizations are focused on making the matching process as
data-driven and objective as possible.

## Definition

Job matching is defined as a service provided by a company or agency aimed at finding
suitable jobs for a candidate. This component of the WAVE model involves matching youth
who have successfully been trained with an employer within WAVE’s employer network.
The match process aligns the candidates’ competencies with the requirements of the
employer, ensuring a higher likelihood of a mutually beneficial work relationship between
both parties. The process focuses not just on the candidate seeking a job, but also on the
Employer Partner (EP) seeking to fill a role with suitable candidates.

## Outcomes

This section of the toolkit will provide you with the tools and resources that will enable you
to:
- Understand the importance of competency based job matching.
- Implement the different components of job placement services.
- Apply WAVE’s job matching principles to effectively place candidates to jobs.

## Why It’s Important

The fourth step in the WAVE model is job matching. The job matching process is aimed at
placing alumni to available job vacancies in EPs. This process requires a dedicated team
to find vacancies, manage alumni, EPs, and the relationship between alumni and EPs.
One of the primary goals of a demand-driven training program is to successfully place
candidates into job roles that require the newly acquired skills and competencies that the
alumni possess. A successful match is one where both alumni and EP are happy with the
outcome, thus leading to higher job retention rates. The job placement service and the
organization’s ability to make this final and critical step a reality validates your
organization’s training curriculum, its ability to collaborate with local EPs in order to close
skills gaps, and ability to merge the unique but co-dependent needs of both alumni and
employers.

As a placement organization, your organization has two main clients - alumni and EP. Both
clients are critical for the success of your business and should be treated and managed with
care. Alumni, EP, and your organization need one another in order to realize individual and
organizational goals and achieve success. The alumni needs a job in order to be financially
secure and meet personal/professional goals, EP requires well trained employees to help
meet the organization’s goals, and your organization needs both alumni and EP to value the
services provided in order for both stakeholders to recommend their peers for your services,
enabling you to meet your targets.
Establishing a solid Career Services and Employer Partnership (CSEP) unit is paramount
for success. As a customer-facing role, it is important to staff the unit with individuals that
are relationship builders, have the capacity to manage expectations and situations, and are
strong communicators. Managing employers and providing top notch customer services
ensures that we are supporting their businesses, and their businesses are positioned to
grow, thus creating job opportunities for our alumni.

## Principles

### Match based on competencies and not credentials.

Matching candidates based on competencies, and not credentials, is the fundamental
principle WAVE applies when it places its candidates into job vacancies. “Competencies
specify “how” a person performs a job tasks, while skills focus on “what” the person needs
in order to perform the job successfully. Competencies “include abilities and behaviors, as
well as knowledge that is fundamental to the use of a skill.” Credentials, on the other hand,
refer to a person’s qualifications, such as academic achievements or certifications. Utilizing
a competency based model versus a credential based model in job placement leads to
better matches and optimum on the job performance translating to greater job satisfaction
and higher retention rates: a win-win for all stakeholders.
Competency based matching will be new to EPs who have heavily relied on credentials or
past experiences as the foundation for their hiring practices. As a result, during initial
partnership meetings with EPs, WAVE makes the case for competency based matching in
order to clearly demonstrate the benefits to all stakeholders.

:::note Principle in Action!
Below are some supporting points to help make your case for competency based matching.
- The world is changing, companies including tech giants like Google, Apple and IBM do not
require candidates to have a college degree.
Furthermore, competency based recruitment:
- Improves objectivity in the recruiting process.
- Ensures the best fit is hired for the vacancy.
- Reduces turnover rate, thus reducing hiring and retraining costs.
- Provides standards for evaluating the success of the selection process, e.g. correlating the
results of the selection process with competency-based on-the-job performance.
:::

### Use objective tools such as competency tests to better match candidates to job.

Competency based job matching is critical as it leads to better matches and higher retention
rates - a win-win for all stakeholders. However, in order to get such results, it is important to
utilize assessment tools. Employment competency tools are computer or paper-based tools
used to measure candidates’ competencies in a standardized manner. These tools enable
matching organizations to have a better understanding of the competency levels of its
alumni.

There are various competency and assessment tools, which assess different abilities
including behavioral, technical, computer literacy skills, cognitive abilities, grit, etc. As a result, when making a selection for the best tool to utilize, it is important to ensure the
selected tools measure the competencies and skills which EPs have stated to be of
importance.

It is important to remember that the overall goal is to ensure a successful match where both
alumni and EPs are satisfied with the placement. This can only be achieved by carefully
shortlisting candidates that best match the competency requirements of a given job role.
Many candidates can learn the required skills for a job; however, in addition to those skills,
competencies (things that will make them successful on the job) and the level at which a
candidate is performing, are important in the job matching process.

WAVE utilizes various competency exams and assessment tools to align the candidate as
closely as possible to the job requirements. The tools utilized vary in terms of what they
assess in a candidate. Every WAVE alumnus takes WAVE’s competency exams which
forms their profile. The results are logged against their profile on a computer-based system
and when a vacancy is available only those that match the required competencies are
short-listed.

Competency assessments are often licensed exams, which have to be paid for. However
there are many on the market, which are priced at different price points. WAVE currently
uses Core Score and Berke (licensed competency assessments) along with other
assessment tools created in house to test for specific skills such as digital literacy.
Berke is a pre-employment assessment that uses data-driven insights to predict hiring
success. Berke can be used to measure personality traits and problem-solving skills and
compare candidates to job benchmarks customized to your company.

Core Score® is an innovative portfolio of competency-based soft skills assessments for
entry and mid-skill workers and jobs. Core Score® may be used to measure an individual's
skills, as well identify those likely to be good and top performers on the job.

:::note Principle in Action!
How to identify relevant assessments:
- Identify and define the core competencies your organization is interested in assessing for
(Note, it should mirror that required from the labour market).
- Conduct desk research to find out what competency assessment tools are available on the
market and which ones you can create in house.
- Speak to HR industry professionals to gain insights on what tools are best suited for your
organizations' needs.
- If budget is a concern, partner with organizations' that have access to licensed assessments at
negotiated best rates.
- Select competency tools that are user friendly and provide explanatory reports which test takes can go through in order to understand their profile.
:::

### A successful match is one where both alumni and employers are happy, and retention rates are high.

WAVE defines a successful match as one where both alumni and employers are satisfied
with the placement and retention rates are high. A satisfied alumnus is excited to go into his
or her place of employment, and looks forward to building a long career in the organization.
A happy EP is satisfied with the value the alumnus is creating and has no need to lay him or
her off unless as a result of operating problems. Happy and satisfied clients are an indicator
that the entire program from the curriculum design to the placement phases is meeting its
objectives and outcomes.

WAVE ensures that it gathers data on both employer and alumni satisfaction and job
retention rates by utilizing satisfaction surveys. This data is used to adjust and improve the
process. In addition, WAVE ensures customers are happy by providing EPs with additional
services such as quarterly training for alumni,, custom trainings and workshops.
Both alumni and EPs are satisfied if their expectations are met and if they feel like their
needs are being met. By analyzing data collected over the years, WAVE has identified 6
key indicators that are predictive of whether an alumni will accept a job offer, stay on the job
and perform. If there is a strong alignment between these indicators and the job description,
a successful match can be realized.

Indicators:
1) Salary Alignment
2) Percentage of income spent on commuting
3) Competency ranking
4) Job role preference
5) Motivator rankings
6) Average commuting time

:::note Principle in Action!
Retention rates are high when expectations are met and aligned. Issues reported by both EP and
alumni are taken seriously and investigated in order to ensure issues are resolved. Below are
examples of common issues and how WAVE addresses them.
Alumni Reported issues:
- Instances of abuse – verbal, physical and/or sexual are investigated. EPs that are found guilty of
any of these types of abuses will have their contracts terminated with WAVE and all alumni
removed from the business.
- Salary reduction/non-payment – EPs that do not pay alumni salary for 2 months or more are
terminated.
- Working hours – EPs contracts are terminated if alumni work more than 12 hours a day/6 days a week
EP Reported issues:
- General performance complaints – All general complaints reported by EP must follow the steps
outlined in the How to Resolve Reported EP Issue guideline. If the issue can not be resolved,
invoke the Customer Service and Guarantee program clause.
- Theft – If there is evidence of theft, alumnus must refund the employer with cash. If the alumnus
cannot afford to refund the employer, the alumnus’ guarantor is bound by the tripartite
agreement to compensate the employer, and an additional agreement needs to be signed by all
parties to this effect.
:::

### Relationship management is key and keeps you in business.

Managing alumni and EP relationships is critical to staying in business. Your organization’s
success relies on the success of your alumni and their performance within the businesses
in which they are placed in. Equally important is the EP, which provides the job
opportunities for your alumni. Thus, it is important to not only establish good relationships,
but also to continuously manage those relationships with the aim of ensuring all
stakeholders are satisfied with the process and have a positive experience. Open and
constant communication, as well as managing expectations, are important in relationship
management. Happy customers lead to referrals and repeat service.
WAVE incorporates the principle of relationship management in every aspect of its process.

At the recruitment phase, the organization seeks to ensure all candidates have a positive
experience regardless of if they gain admissions into the program as they will return to the
community and be unofficial spokespeople. A positive experience can be created by simply
being courteous, answering all questions, following up with candidates, and thoroughly
explaining the program during the information sessions. When an alumnus is selected for
interview, he or she is provided with detailed information about the job before hand, given
tips about how to perform, gets a toolkit which serves as a brief reminder on the do’s and
don’ts, as well as a phone call the day of interview from a WAVE staff. Managing and
showing that we care about their success helps them perform at their best.
Before officially engaging an EP, WAVE holds a thorough meeting in order to understand
the EP’s human resource needs as well as organizational growth plans. In addition, EPs are
educated on WAVE’s terms and conditions for engagement to ensure they fully understand
their obligations to WAVE and alumni, and WAVE’s obligation to them. A WAVE team
constantly provides additional services and support throughout the course of WAVE’s
relationship with an EP.

:::note Principle in Action!
Follow these tips in order to build and manage relationships with your EPs:
- Ensure your EP’s satisfaction is your number one priority. Clearly outline a customer promise
and guarantee program to ensure EPs are getting value from your service.
- Routinely invite EPs to events your organization is hosting (e.g. graduations, annual gatherings).
This will keep them in the loop of activities, while providing them with an opportunity to observe
your organization’s growth and impact.
- Include EPs in your mailing list and send quarterly (or annual) reports about your organization
and its impact.
- Send end of the year thank you letter and/or corporate gift (if available).
- Publicly recognize EPs for their contribution to your organization’s success.
- Periodically check in on EPs who have employed youth from your training program. This can be
done via a phone conversation or by administering an employer satisfaction survey.
Follow these tips in order to build and manage relationships with your alumni:
- Manage expectations of alumni – do not promise what you can not deliver.
- Create easy to use toolkits to help alumni prepare for upcoming interviews.
- Communicate once a month with alumni to monitor their on the job progress.
- Find ways to involve alumni in order to make them feel as a part of a community – create case
studies on their post training experience, invite alumni as guest speakers, acknowledge their
successes publicly.

### Monitor alumni/employee satisfaction to improve matching.

It is important to understand if your customers are happy with your services. However it is
not enough to only monitor the current state of your alumni and employees; the ultimate
goal is to use the information gathered from the collected data to improve your overall
matching process.

Satisfaction surveys do not only provide information on current customer satisfaction but
over time can become a predictive tool on gathering information on what actually makes a
customer satisfied. Over the years, WAVE has analyzed its data with the aim of narrowing
down predictors of success from the alumni’s perspective. These predictors, including
motivation, location, salary, competency, alignments and ability to learn on the job, have
helped with better matching, further improving the process and creating efficiencies.

:::note Principle in Action!
Tips on monitoring EP satisfaction:
- Monitor employer by administering an employer satisfaction survey.
- If alumni has been fired, provide an employer dissatisfaction survey to gain insights on what
went wrong.
- If EP reports issues with alumni, aim to contact EP within 24 hours of hearing the issue and
resolve all issues reported within 5 business days.
- Keep track of issues and share with curriculum design team in order to train future trainees on
recurring issues.
- Analyze data to understand what key factors make an EP satisfied with your service.
Tips on monitoring alumni satisfaction
- Monitor alumni satisfaction by administering an alumni retention survey.
- Have genuine conversations with alumni about their jobs and progress.
- Analyze data to understand what key factors make an alumni satisfied with your service.
- Use those key factors to improve matching.
:::

### Agreements are necessary to protect all stakeholders.

It is important to have a document that clearly spells out what is expected from each party.
This document serves as the point of reference if situations arise.
WAVE utilizes a tripartite agreement, which is signed between WAVE, the selected
candidate, and EP. The agreement is a legally binding contract which documents all the
terms of the job including salary, working hours and conditions, expectations from all
stakeholders to one another, and guaranty terms.

:::note Principle in Action!
Sample Agreements
Use WAVE’s Tripartite Agreement and adapt to your organization’s need.
:::

### Gather data in order to validate competency tools to ensure accuracy.

Once an investment has been made in a competency tool, it is important to validate the
data the tool produces to ensure that the tool is being predictive and helping the
organization shortlist the best candidates for a particular job role. It is important to keep in
the forefront that competency tools are to help make the matching process more objective,
scientific and efficient. Validating competency scores ensures there’s a strong correlation
between alumni scores and scores provided by employers.
WAVE validates competency results by administering surveys to its EPs. Using the PRS
survey (qualitative survey created by Core Score) the team is able to gather data on if a
certain competency tool accurately predicted that a candidate would perform well in a given
role, which highlighted certain competencies as key. It is important to note that the word
“predicted” within this context means the ability to identify a particular competency in a
candidate. In addition, with further analysis, the organization uses the data to narrow down
what key competencies its high performers and low performers have in common. The data
from that exercise is used to further improve the entire program from the curriculum to
matching.

:::note Principle in Action!
There are several ways to validate competency results. Below is a method WAVE uses to
understand if the competency tool, Core Score, is predictive of how an alumni will perform on the job. The process is continuously being improved upon.

Core Score provides a quantitative result, while the PRS survey is qualitative.
1. Administer competency assessment and record the score in alumni management database.
2. Once alumni is placed in a job, administer PRS survey to EP to get a qualitative assessment of
alumni’s performance.
3. Compare score to PRS survey results
oIf alumni received a high score on the Core Score competency assessment, it is expected that
reported performance will be excellent, above average., the opposite is expected.
4. Keep track of data and analyze to examine trends.

## The WAVE Way

### Competency Based Job-Matching

Matching alumni to jobs based on competency ensures that the matching process is
objective and the best set of people for a specific job role is shortlisted, thus creating a
higher likelihood of a successful match. As a demand-driven program, the aim is to ensure
that alumni are up skilled (trained) with competencies and skills that are relevant and
desired by EPs. The training program should therefore focus on the desired skills and
competencies.
 Selecting a Competency Assessment
- Confirm with EP the key competencies it requires and the desired skill level.
- Conduct research on the various assessment tools on the market (Note: there are
some free tools which can be used, while others require a significant financial
investment).
- Decide which tools can be created in-house in order to reduce cost (Note: Microsoft
Excel and Word tests can be created in-house)
- Select relevant assessment test.
- Confirm that assessment tests are appropriate by ensuring your audience can easily
use it.
Validating Competency Assessment
- Administer the competency test to alumni.
- Record candidates’ scores in database (Excel, Sales force).
- Once candidates are placed in jobs, conduct Alumni Satisfaction Survey and
Employer Satisfaction Survey.
- Analyze survey results by looking for commonalities across all candidates.

### Career Services

Career Services is the unit in an organization that provides information, advice and
guidance on learning, training, career choice, career development, job search, and the
labour market. The objective of the unit is to work with the alumni in getting prepared for an
interview and eventually placing the alumni in a paid job within weeks of graduating.
The career services unit offers three types of services: pre-match, matching and
post-match.

#### Pre- Match
- CV preparation. In order to get an alumni prepared for a potential job interview, it is
important that they have a strong resume which reflects their skills and job experience.
- Elevator Pitch. An elevator pitch is a quick overview of a candidate’s background and
experience. At WAVE, it is in a 30-second video format which alumni record during the
training session and is presented to EPs in order for them to select candidates they
want to interview. EPs can assess particular traits such as appearance, diction, non-verbal communication, and confidence.
- Mock Interview. All alumni must go through a mock interview to help them better
acquaint themselves with an interview environment and potential questions. Mock
interviews better prepare the candidates as they get feedback on their performances
and know areas of strength and weaknesses to improve upon.
- Administer Competency Exams. Administering competency exams to all candidates
will enable your organization to match candidates to jobs in a more objective and
data-driven manner. Assessments reveal more about your candidate’s true potential,
personality, and work style. In addition, assessments enable the candidate to
understand their strengths and weaknesses and identify what type of jobs is best suited
for them.
- Hold Career Services Day. Implementers are advised to hold a Career Services Day, a
day in which alumni gather together to understand what will be expected from them once
they are placed, and additional resources on how to secure jobs for themselves. At this
forum it is important to review an employment guideline, contracts, and competencies
required for different job vacancy categories.

#### Match
- Announce Vacancy to Alumni. Once there is a vacancy, announce it to your alumni to
gauge interest.
- Shortlist 3- 4 candidates for EP selection. Use Alumni Management database to
identify and shortlist alumni with the required competencies for the available vacancy.
Send CVs and elevator pitches to EP.
- Retrieve shortlisted candidates and feedback from EP. EP selects candidates they
want to interview. Ask for feedback for all shortlisted candidates. Enter feedback into Alumni Management Database.
- Inform selected candidates of interview. Send interview details via email and text
messages to candidates. Specify that candidate should confirm receipt of message, and
should also call once they are done with the interview.
Call alumni to confirm dress code, transportation route, and share information about
employer (name, type of business, location, role and duties). In addition, check in
on alumni 2 hours before interview to confirm they are en route.
- Provide candidates with pre-interview toolkit. A pre-interview toolkit is a simple guide
that highlights the necessary do’s and don’ts of an interview. A cheat sheet of sorts
should be distributed to candidates to help them prepare for their upcoming interview.
- Interview feedback. After the interview, have a phone debrief session with the
candidate to get their assessment of the interview.
- Share EPs Feedback. Pass on feedback, whether positive or negative, from the
employer to the alumnus.
- Match. If alumnus is selected, notify the candidate and sign the Tripartite Agreement
between WAVE, alumnus and recruiting organization. The agreement outlines the terms
and conditions that are in align with WAVE’s values and compensation structure and are
designed to ensure that both recruiting organization and alumni fulfill their financial
obligations to WAVE. WAVE ensures that it provides excellent customer service to the
recruiting organization as well as continuous support for alumni, while alumni are
ensured they are working under acceptable working conditions and being paid the
agreed upon salary.

#### Post-Match

- Check-ins. Periodically check in with both alumni and employer to ensure the
relationship is going well.

### Employer Partnerships
Building partnerships with employers is a process of identifying and establishing meaningful
relationships with hiring organizations in order to reach mutually beneficial goals. It is
important to note that employer partnerships is an ongoing process, and is foundational to
your program. Ideally, your organization should already have formed solid partnerships with
employers at the curriculum development stage when EPs provide data on the types of
skills and competencies that are relevant for their industries.
The objective of engaging potential EPs is to develop new partners with the aim of listing a
vacancy while maintaining relationships with current employers of your alumni.

#### Steps in building new/maintaining old relationships
- Network frequently in order to gain insights on organizations that are hiring or those that
require the services your organization provides.
- Ask current EPs to refer your services to other organizations.
- Identify/outline your organization’s value proposition. Develop a presentation about your
organization and what it can offer to different partners. The presentation should include
relevant information about your organization, such as its mission, vision, services and
value proposition. Ensure the value proposition is aligned with the EPs goals.
- Be responsive with EPs, always follow up with partners on agreed next steps. Following
up ensures that you are continuously engaged with your partners and are constantly
keeping your end of the bargain. Follow up in a systematic manner.
- Maintain relationships with EPs by checking in to ensure alumnus is performing well and
that their business is thriving.
- Administer employer satisfaction survey to gauge EP’s satisfaction with your services
and alumni.

#### Steps in signing an EP, listing a vacancy, and matching an alumni to a job
1. Identify prospective EP and vacancies.
2. Get to know your partner by visiting office.
3. During initial face- to -face meeting, understand prospective EPs recruiting
need/vacancy.
4. Send email containing your organization's Terms of Partnership to prospective EP
5. Once Terms of Partnership is signed, jointly create job description (JD).
6. Work with Career Services department to shortlist candidates that best fit the JD
(Note: Manage all communication between prospective EP and Alumni).
7. Send at least 3 CVs and Elevator Pitches to prospective EP.
8. Debrief with prospective EP on candidates that were not shortlisted in order to
provide candidates feedback on CV/elevator pitches.
9. Confirm final interview selection with EP and communicate information (interview
time and location ) to selected alumni.
10. Follow up with prospective EP post interview for a debrief on selected candidate.
11. Sign tripartite agreement if alumni accepts position
12. Send EP satisfaction survey.
13. If employer responds negatively on the satisfaction survey, send a dissatisfaction
survey.
14. Conduct scheduled check-ins in person to gather information on alumni performance
and to main relationship with EP

looking at them or hearing them talk.
- The aim is not to find assessments for all competencies, but rather focusing on the
competencies that matter most.
- Build partnerships with organizations that share the same goals as your organization.
- Remain open-minded. Focus on what is working. Always focus your mind on the idea of
"scaling up” and have accurate data!
