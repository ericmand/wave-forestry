organization as well. Supporting alumni in their professional development shows that you

Alumni are walking testaments of your organization’s services. A happy and successful
alumusi is an indicator that your program is meeting its intended purpose.

## Principles

### Alumni are the unofficial public face of your organization and their success is your organization’s success.

An employed alumni is the face of your organization; thus, it is important from a brand
management perspective to ensure that their behavior and performance is consistently in
line with your expectations as an organization. It is also important to make sure that
program alumni are not only placed in jobs, but that they are successful within the jobs.
Periodic check-ins via phone calls enable you to get a better understanding of their job
performance.

WAVE conducts its check-ins through alumni development workshops. Holding a quarterly
workshop is a way to gather all your alumni together and hold a debrief session where they
can provide feedback on how their employment is going, seek additional guidance on how
to deal with difficult situations, and for the organization to re-share its employment
guidelines and policies. At these workshops, you can hold mini refreshers on technical skills
learned during training, as well as advertise new vacancies. WAVE also conducts Master
classes, which provide refresher courses on soft skills topics covered during the training. In
addition, surveys are conducted to alumni to get a sense of how they are faring on the job.

### Establishing an alumni community ensures your alumni are lifelong supporters of the organization.

Establishing an engaged and supportive alumni network is critical for your organization's
success. As mentioned previously, alumni are the public face of your organization and its
impact. Keeping them engaged and active through the alumni network will keep them as
good ambassadors of your organization.

WAVE engages alumni through monthly check -ins, quarterly workshops and mentorship. In
addition, WAVE curates continuous Learning & Improvement Opportunities (master
classes, online learning, network of training providers) and supports entrepreneurship
endeavors.
