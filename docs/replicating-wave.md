## Why Replicate?

Organizations and institutions looking to provide services, such as job placement, to youth
may seek to replicate the model due to its proven success over the years. The WAVE
model has successfully matched youth to entry-level job roles through the robust use of
data, which drives its processes and job placements.

Replicating the WAVE model is:
- Reliable: increases the impact of the replicating organizationâ€™s skills training programs
by improving employability levels, employment outcomes and earning potential.
- Affordable: open source toolkit at no cost to the replicator. Additional support services
available at affordable costs.
- Convenient: includes simple principles delivered in multiple formats from this DIY toolkit
to virtual and in class support
- Scalable: achieves greater cost efficiency in terms of the rate at which participants can
be trained, the usage level of the various resources required (people, materials) and
delivery cost per candidate trained.
- Accessible: few prerequisites for implementation

## Organization Readiness

Before deciding whether or not to implement the WAVE replicator toolkit, it is important to
assess if the toolkit is the best resource for your organization. WAVE has identified various
types of organizations that are ideal replicators. Go through the checklist to determine if
your organization is the right fit.

## WAVE Support

Each section of the toolkit has a list of services WAVE provides to replicators that are
interested in additional implementation support. These services are offered a la carte and
are provided virtually or in class for a fee which varies depending on the service requested.
In addition, WAVE provides a 5-day activation training for replicators that are interested in a
comprehensive in-person training on the WAVE model, principles, curriculum design and
delivery, monitoring & evaluation, business operations (financial sustainability, fundraising,
financial planning & budgeting) and strategic planning.

Replicators interested in any of the services offered by WAVE should contact the WAVE
replication team at info@waveacademies.org.
