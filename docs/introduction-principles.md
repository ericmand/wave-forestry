## Audience

This section of the toolkit is targeted towards organizations that are interested in either
designing a demand-driven program, or using the principles provided in order to revamp
their existing program to be more aligned with the principles of a demand- driven program.
Organizations that utilize this section are committed to the end to end process of a
demand-driven program, i.e. from design to implementation. The ultimate goal is to place its
target population (youth) into paying jobs, or provide them with the necessary skills to be
gainfully self-employed. These organizations are committed to providing long term services
to youth.

## Definition

Demand-driven training (DDT) refers to skills development initiatives that are customized to
respond directly to the specific requirements of a job role, for an employer or a group of
employers, and lead to placement in employment or self-employment. The program or
initiative aims to up-skill young people with specific skills that are necessary for a specific
job or types of job, thus closing the skills gap. Once up-skilled, the program aims to place
the newly trained youth in the identified jobs, thus creating a win-win situation for all
stakeholders (employers, youth and your organization).

## Outcomes

This section of the toolkit will provide you with the tools and resources that will enable you
to:
- Understand the driving principles behind WAVE’s processes
- Conduct effective labour market research
- Build lasting partnerships with employer partners (EP)
- Design a labour market driven training curriculum
- Design the training to employment connection component of the model

## Why It’s Important

Across Africa, millions of young people are unemployed or underemployed, accounting for
60% of the continent’s unemployed population. With 200 million people between the ages of
15-24, Africa has the largest population of young people in the world. Therefore,
organizations focusing on youth empowerment and employability require solutions which
will enable young people to be either self-employed or gainfully employed within the formal
sector.

Traditional training programs often fail to match young people with jobs and other economic
opportunities, or tend to teach them skills and competencies that are not applicable to their
local job market reality. On the other hand, businesses, especially small and medium
enterprises (SMEs), do not have the internal capacity or resources to up-skill employees
and close the necessary skill gaps. As a result, they face high turnover and low retention
rates.

A demand-driven program is an important model which not only provides solutions for the
young candidate seeking a fulfilling job, but also the employer looking to hire well trained
individuals. The model takes into account the real and evolving needs of employer partners
and uses that knowledge as the foundation for subsequent training programs. This
approach enables young people to be empowered with the relevant skill sets, knowledge,
and competencies to be successful in a job. 

Additionally, the model enables organizations
to have well trained individuals working towards the growth of their organization. The model
creates a win-win situation for all stakeholders, and research has shown that “training
programs that work closely with employers are the most successful at integrating young
people into the economy.”

## Principles

### Involve Employer Partners in your program design and development phases to ensure better program alignment and outcomes.

One of the core principles in creating a successful demand driven program is to ensure that
Employer Partners (EPs) are actively involved in your design and development stages. The
aim of involving EPs within your program design and development phases. This secures the
EPs as allies that will serve as subject matter experts, provide their expert approval of
content, support your organization’s mission and vision, and eventually employ your newly
trained trainees. EPs that are involved in the development phases better understand your
product, your value proposition, and will be more supportive in hiring trainees as they have
vetted your curriculum and confirmed it is aligned with their requirements.
At WAVE, EPs were involved in every stage of the program and curriculum design. We
established initial relationships after conducting labour market research and consolidated
those relationships by inviting a few partners to serve on an advisory board. The advisory
board reviewed the curriculum to ensure it was aligned with the needs of their respective
sectors and provided their inputs and perspectives. Some EPs provided team members
who served as training facilitators, further enhancing the program by bridging the gap
between theory and practice. As a result of the content alignment, EPs were confident that
the skills and competencies taught in our program were aligned with theirs.

:::note Principle in Action!
As a replicator, involve EPs in your program design by following these steps:
1. Identify the top 20-50 businesses in your catchment area. Top businesses can be defined by
staff strength, i.e., number of full time employees, available job vacancies, or annual revenue.
Note: leverage online job portals, newspaper adverts, and government reports to identify
businesses. For those in rural or per-urban regions For those in rural or peri-urban regions,
observe where goods and money flows in to or out of the region, this will lead you to the largest
businesses. For example, who are the largest distributors, sellers or manufacturers of the
fastest-moving products or services in your area? The largest employers are likely to be the
largest source of future job growth and those with current vacancies are likely to be growing in
terms of job creation.
2. Establish contact with person that makes decisions on business and/or hiring – Chief Executive
Officer (CEO), Chief Operation Officer (COO), HR Manager. These individuals are often in the
best position to provide you with details about their industry and organization.
3. Administer labour market research questionnaire to understand job-growth potential etc.
4. Analyze labour market survey results and select industry/organizations that are aligned with
your proposed vision and mission for the training. Ensure your organization is equipped to train
for the selected industry.
5. Select organizations you wish to acquire as partners. Selection should be based on your
organization’s industry preference, industry’s growth potential, your organization's capacity to
train candidates for that industry and alignment in values and mission with potential partner
organization.
6. Re-establish contact with organizations’ representative, seek for interview with decision maker
and invite the representative to sit on the design and content review team. It is important to
clearly lay out the level of involvement required from your partners while keeping in mind that
this is not their primary responsibility.
7. Design program with the input of your selected partners while ensuring their feedback is
provided on all levels.

### Build lasting relationships with employer partners in order to improve program outcomes and grow business operations.

Building strong alliances with employer partners (EPs) that you have identified as potential
partners can help with the impact and financial sustainability of your program, especially in
its beginning stages. This principle is relevant for organizations that focus on youth
employment initiatives and recruiting or matching agencies. EPs can provide valuable input
into your program design as well as serve as potential avenues for work-based or
experiential learning for trainees through internships, apprenticeships and post-training
placements. The possibilities are endless with a business that buys into your organization’s
mission and vision, and sees a close alignment with their own organization’s growth. It is
important to always design a partnership program focused on delivering a clear value
proposition and customer promise to the EP. Aim to create win-win situations by outlining
the benefits for the partners in order for the relationship to flourish.

At WAVE we strive to create lasting relationships by focusing not only on what the EP can
do to help our organization grow, but also what we can do to help the EP meet its unique
objectives. With this mindset, WAVE has an Employer Partnerships Program designed
around the value proposition of "simple and effective process to find entry-level work.”
Effectiveness is measured in turnaround time, cost and accuracy (quality/on-the-job
retention) of vacancy filling or job matching. This means that our resources, processes and
priorities are all focused on finding the right talent for our EPs in the shortest time possible,
which also lowers the cost to both sides. We provide an alumni replacement guarantee
which guarantees the EP a replacement if their hired candidate’s employment is terminated
within 6 months. Both sides are aligned towards the same outcomes: performance and
retention. The higher the quality of the placement, the more cost-effective for both sides!

:::note Principle in Action!
Follow these tips in order to build lasting relationships with your EPs:
1. Your EP’s satisfaction is your number one priority. Clearly outline a
customer promise and guarantee program to ensure EPs are getting value from your service.
2. Routinely invite EPs to events your organization is hosting (e.g. speaker series during training,
graduation ceremony, customer insight events, employer-focused gatherings). This will keep
them in the loop of activities and provides them with an opportunity observe your organization’s
growth and impact.
3. Include EPs in your mailing list and send quarterly (or annual) reports about your organization
and its impact.
4. Recognize your EPs by creating simple and cost effective ways to ocassionally appreciate them.
For example, certificates (creatively designed by trainees) to recognize the most outstanding
employers. Other categories include: best working conditions, most responsive EP (to surveys),
EP with the most constructive feedback, best turnaround time on invoices.
5. Appreciate EPs by sending end of the year thank you letter, holiday greeting cards, company
calendar, anniversary cards and/or corporate gifts (if available). Items should be simple,
cost-effective and cheerful.
6. Publicly recognize EPs for their contribution to your organization’s success.
7. Periodically check in on EPs who have employed youth from your training program. This can be
done via a phone conversation or administering an employer partner satisfaction survey.
:::

The program is managed by our Employer Partnership Management team which is in
continuous discussions with EPs to understand their human resources needs both in the
short term and medium/long term.

In addition to Employer Partnerships Program, we provide training workshops for employers
to be educated on talent management, and patronize and promote the product/service
offerings of our employer partners where possible. 

In addition, we hold annual awards
recognizing their contribution to our mission and vision. All these initiatives have helped
WAVE secure repeat businesses from our EPs as well as gain referrals to other EPs.

### Maintain focus on desired outcomes to better guide your curriculum development.

“Begin with the end in mind!” Beginning with the end in mind, often referred to as backward
design in the world of curriculum and instructional design, enables you to keep your focus
on your target audience. There are many benefits to this approach of focusing your
curriculum development team on the outcome – what will your target audience get from
taking the training, what skills and set of knowledge would they have gained. In order to
successfully implement this approach, it is important to first identify the results – the ideas
and skills you want trainees to gain. These skills should be aligned with what both EPs and
candidates require. Next, you determine (using assessments) how candidates will
demonstrate that they have indeed learned the identified skills, and then plan the learning
experiences and instruction (i.e. content and activities).

::note Principles in Action!
Follow these steps in order to ensure your curriculum is focused on desired outcomes.
1. Ask EPs, what skills/traits and behaviours are essential to succeeding in specific roles
(identified as top growth roles in Labour Market Research Questionnaire).
2. Ask EPs how they identify, assess and validate whether candidates possess these traits
3. Ask EPs how they train for said traits
4. Speak to existing top performing employees in said roles to verify what traits they think are
most critical for success. Inquire about why and how they developed said skills and traits.
5. Design Training Curriculum based on this input
6. Test curriculum with EPs to gain feedback
7. Incorporate feedback into the curriculum

### Utilize activity-based (experiential) learning to motivate participants and improve learning retention.

Adult learners, i.e. individuals who are older than the traditional school age, often have
competing life priorities and therefore find themselves juggling between these priorities and
being engaged in a training program. Such learners often voluntarily enroll themselves into
training programs and can just as easily remove themselves if they do not think the program
is engaging or can help solve one of their immediate challenges - in this case
unemployment. As a result, training programs that cater to such audiences must find ways
to motivate and engage participants through various instructional methodologies.

Experiential learning is the process of learning through experience or activities, more
specifically defined as "learning through reflection or doing”. Experiential education first
immerses learners in an experience and then encourages reflection about the experience to
develop new skills, new attitudes, or new ways of thinking. It has been proven to resonate
with adult learners. Its core premises include the requirement that learning should be based
on doing some hands-on experiments and activities. Experiential learning drives the
learning home and improves retention of the information. When someone can feel or link an
emotion to a piece of information, one is in a better position to retain it than if they just
memorized it.

WAVE aims to incorporate experiential activities in every module. These activities serve to
reinforce key ideas and concepts, as well as provide trainees with real world examples.

Trainees often start the training program with an activity, which engages them on a team
scavenger hunt. This activity on the first day of training introduces trainees to key concepts
that will be covered throughout the duration of the training. Concepts such as leadership,
taking initiative, effective communication, teamwork, creativity, problem solving, time
management and goal setting, can all be reinforced in one activity and serve as a platform
for group discussions, in-depth analyses, reflection and future application

1. Concrete Experience
(Doing/Having an experience)
2. Reflective Observation
(Reviewing/Reflecting on this
experience)
3. Abstract Conceptualisation
(Concluding/Learning from the
experience, synthesizing new
knowledge and perspectives)
4. Active Experimentation
(Planning/Trying out what you have
 learned in future scenarios)

:::note Principle in Action!
Steps in designing experiential activities:
1. Identify which parts of your curriculum will benefit from experiential learning (e.g. Negotiation
Module)
2. Think of problems or essential questions you want trainees to solve or think about. This should be
aligned with the objectives and outcomes of the module (How to use communication, problem
solving methods, creativity as tools for negotiations)
3. Identify or create activities will help bring out the identified “problems” (e.g. purchasing lunch for the
team with a set budget).
4. Identify relevant and thought provoking questions which trainees can use to reflect on their
experience post activity. Reflection can be done as a group, individually in log books etc.
5. Identify theories or concepts that are relevant to the subject in order to explain experience and
ideas generated from reflection (Game Theory, Stages of Negotiations, BATNA, Non-Verbal
Communication)
