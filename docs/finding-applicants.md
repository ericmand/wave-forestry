title: Finding Applicants

---
## Audience

This section of the toolkit is targeted towards replicators that are in the beginning stages of
their operations, i.e. building their brand recognition and reputation. The main characteristic
of such a replicating organization is that it typically does not have a steady stream of young
people to train and match to jobs; thus, the priority is to actively seek out young people to
utilize its services. This section is also valuable for replicators that are interested in learning
how to effectively recruit young people into youth-focused programs in a cost-effective,
efficient and data-driven manner.
Finding Applicants

## Definition

Finding candidates is the act of identifying new people to join the training program. This is
usually done through an outreach initiative.
Outreach is as an act of proactively reaching out to a targeted population who need a set of
services rather than waiting for the identified population to come and ask for help. Outreach
marketing focuses “on human to human connection” while encouraging the establishment of
“connection with your consumers instead of marketing at them” For new and relatively
young organizations, outreach can help with building brand awareness.

## Outcomes

This section of the toolkit will provide you with the tools and resources that will enable you
to:

* Apply the principles of how WAVE finds candidates for its program through their
  outreach efforts.
* Understand how to replicate two of WAVE’s most effective outreach approaches.

## Why It’s Important

The first step in the WAVE process is outreach, which focuses on finding self-motivated,
underserved youth who are willing to learn and determined to succeed. The dedicated
Outreach and Admissions team carries out the process. This team is mandated to recruit
candidates for screening in order to enroll them in the training program.

At WAVE, a strong recruitment and outreach initiative enables the organization to raise
awareness about its program while proactively targeting the desired population. Over the
years, WAVE has learned that for for every 100 people that apply to the training program,
an average of 25-30 will graduate the program. As a result, it is advised that the outreach
team target 4 times as many people as they would like to graduate!

## Principles

### Your message is vital for recruitment.

The message to your target audience is one of the most important steps as it represents
your organization’s opportunity to articulate the problem proposition (what is the problem
your customer is experiencing and how big is it), the value proposition (what is the solution
you are offering and the value of this solution) and why your target audience should pay
attention. It is important to understand your unique value proposition and sell it with a
message that is easy to understand. Your message should be short and impactful, leaving
potential candidates with the desire to attend the the next step of the admissions process,
an information session. Given the importance of messaging, all carriers of the message
should be adequately trained to deliver it accurately and consistently.

As best practice, WAVE keeps its messages clear, concise and brief in order to entice
potential participants to want to learn more. By strategically keeping the message short and
limiting the information about the program provided during the first interaction with a
potential participant, WAVE makes it more likely that participants will show up to an
information session. At this point, the participants get to learn more about the program and
interact with senior team members.

Below are tips in creating a marketing message

* Know your audience
* Get to the point
* Take the target audience’s view point
* Focus on a few themes – keep messaging simple
* Differentiate your service from others
* Articulate your audience’s problem and solve it
* Have a call for action (next steps)

### Target youth through various outreach channels in order to drive awareness.

Every organization must invest in some form of marketing and outreach effort in order to
build its brand recognition and awareness. In the early stage, it is recommended that all
outreach approaches be explored in order to gather data on the most cost effective and
efficient channel. To attain the best results, outreach efforts should focus on areas where
youth gather en masse and build connections with people that have positive influences on
their lives.
For example, at WAVE, the program was marketed through several channels including
word of mouth, alumni referrals, town-storming, social media, partnerships at the state and
local government levels, radio, conferences, religious institutions, etc. Over the years,
through the use of collected data, WAVE has refined its main outreach channels.

:::note Principle in Action!

1. Invite 3-5 youth to your organization’s brainstorming session.
2. Hold brainstorming session with team members and youth. The objective is to identify locations
   where youth gather and the best method to reach them.
3. List what locations (predictable and unpredictable) locations youth gather en masse either
   formally or informally.
4. Map out the best ways to reach the youth at the different identified locations.

| LOCATION | OUTREACH METHOD |
| --- | --- |
| Football viewing centers where youth often gather to watch games | Pamphlets on tables, representatives “venue storming” after game to provide information about program. |
| Mass Transport Stations | Townstorming – Organization representatives go out to the different stations and target youth on site. |
| Online | Blog posts, paid advertisement on facebook and IG |

1. Implement outreach strategy.
2. Keep track of which method brings in quality candidates and the associated acquisition costs.

### Involve Alumni to yield better results.

Involving proponents of your program is a highly effective recruiting tool. Even more
effective is if the proponent is an individual that has first-hand experience with the program
and can effectively speak about the impact it has had on his on her life. An enthusiastic
alumnus is your most powerful sales person. Alumni are in the best position to speak about
the benefits of the program as they are walking testaments of your product.
WAVE has seen the benefit of this principle with the establishment of its alumni referral
program. The program rewards alumni with a modest financial stipend for every candidate
that is referred and graduates the program. Alumni have been the most effective forms of
new candidate referrals into the program, accounting for 45% of new trainee enrollment.

:::note Principle in Action!
Follow the below steps and set up an alumni referral program:

1. As an organization, determine how much you can afford to give alumni that successfully refer
   candidates to the organization. Gift can either be monetary or items such as phone airtime.
2. Create incentive for alumni that refers the most candidates i.e. face of the alumnus on
   organizational promotional materials, speaking opportunities at upcoming training.
3. During graduation and other organization events, announce/remind alumni of the referral
   initiative – provide the rationale for the program, and what alumni stand to gain.
4. Periodically remind alumni of referral program via phone call and/or email

### Making genuine connections will help with advancing participants to next round.

The outreach process should aim to build genuine relationships with your target audience in
order to convince him/her to be part of the next step in your admissions process. This can
be achieved by actively listening and learning about potential candidate’s personal goals
and aligning them with your program’s services. When building relationships, the focus
should be on the quality of the relationships and not the quantity.
WAVE builds genuine connections with potential participants by making the process
personal. Recruiters provide phone numbers which potential participants can reach them on
if they have questions about the program. In addition, recruiters follow up by making
one-on-one phone calls to provide more information about the program and the next steps.

:::note Principle in Action!
Below are tips in building genuine relationships with potential candidates

* When recruiting, focus on how to solve the problems of potential candidates.
* Engage potential candidate in a conversation about their employment journey.
* Willingly provide information about your employment journey in order to spark hope.
* Always follow up with potential candidates with a phone call or sms to remind them of the
  upcoming information session.
* Get personal and familiar – always use the potential candidates name during conversations
* Make yourself available for any questions or concerns that potential candidates may have.

### Use data to drive outreach initiative

Collecting and collating data in an organized manner provides your organization with
information, which can be used to better guide your outreach efforts. Data collection and
analysis enables organizations to remain innovative. With the availability of data, your
organization can determine which outreach method is the most cost-effective and efficient
and which attracts the largest numbers of candidates. The data will help you adjust your
outreach process ahead of the next admission cycle in order to meet or exceed goals.
WAVE collects outreach data by asking how a candidate heard of its program in the
application phase of its process. This data is consistently tracked and analyzed in order to
make an outreach decision. Over the years, through the use of collected data, WAVE has
identified two outreach channels - town storming and alumni referrals - that are extremely
effective in recruiting WAVE fit youth. Town Storming is an activity that generates
awareness of and interest in an organization by mass outreach on the street, while Alumni
Referrals use alumni to recommend people in their network to a program. Together, these
two channels account for over 75% of received applications.

:::note Principle in Action!
Tracking data is important. The following steps will guide you on how to start the process.

1. Identify which indicators (e.g. gender, retention rates etc) are important to you and your funders
   (if you have any).
2. Create candidate application form (paper or electronic) that will enable you to collect the
   identified data.
3. Use information session candidate attendance sheet to gather data as well
4. Transfer information to candidate management database (a database that contains information
   on all candidates)
5. Analyze data
6. Use data to guide next steps and decisions

## The WAVE Way

### Town Storming

The objective of town storming is to establish a connection and build a relationship with
people encountered “in the town” in order to make them want to learn more about WAVE by
attending an information session the following week. While there are targets set for the town
stormers, it is necessary to stress the importance of quality over quantity. This will ensure
that the right type of people will attend the information session.

* Create an outreach plan. Outreach Plan Template
* Create your town storming message. Creating a Town storming Message
* Recruit your town stormers.
* Train town stormers. Training Town stormers (agenda)
* Execute town storming. Town Storming Tips
* Compile list of potential candidates in a central database with contact details.
  Candidate Management Database
* Debrief on town storming. Debrief Questions Sheet
* Follow up with potential candidates. Follow Up Phone Script

### Alumni Referral Program

The objective of alumni referral is to leverage your alumni in recruiting new candidates for
your program. An alumni referral program can yield great recruitment results for your
organization, as alumni are the best “sales reps” of your product due to their first-hand
experience.
Alumni Referral Process

* Leverage organizational events/program. It is important to take advantage of
  organization wide events such as graduations to discuss the importance of alumni
  referrals.
* Stay in touch. We recommend calling alumni one week after their graduation to
  remind them to refer their friends and acquaintances to the program.
* Incentivize Alums. Create an incentive program to encourage alumni to recommend
  their peers. The incentive program provides alumni with monetary or in-kind rewards
  based on number of referrals. Example of rewards includes money transfer to
  account, phone airtime credit and much more. We encourage organizations to get
  creative on how to reward its alumni that provide referrals.

## Lesson Learned/Tips

* Many youth are not aware of their skill gaps and the impact of these gaps on their
  unemployment status, so it becomes important to “show them, and tell them” the gaps.
* Building sustainable and mutually beneficial relationships with candidates requires
  consistency, a good knowledge of relationship building and understanding of the cultural
  context that may obtain.
* Parents, caregivers and influencers may contribute to the unemployment prevalence by
  shielding young people from gaining worthwhile experience and constantly giving handouts. Handouts are our biggest competitor. As a recruiter, ask yourself how you can
  change mindsets; i.e. convince youth to think beyond an immediate short term solution
  of handouts, and to focus on the long term, where they will require the skills they are
  building today.
