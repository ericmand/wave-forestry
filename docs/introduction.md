In West Africa, more than 50 million young people are unemployed or underemployed.
According to the Nigerian National Bureau of Statistics, 55% of Nigeria’s youth are either
unemployed or underemployed. At the root of the problem is a broken education system
that is disconnected from the needs of the labour market. Schools produce graduates who
lack competencies (soft skills, applied skills, technical skills, and critical thinking abilities),
which are necessities even for entry-level employment.

Unable to obtain full-time jobs, these young graduates turn to the informal sector, where
they earn less than $2 per day. Youth have talent and potential, but without relevant
education and a pathway from school to good employment, they and their communities are
locked in a cycle of poverty.

Different entities (governments, youth focused non-profits, businesses) are in position to
tackle youth unemployment by equipping youth with the necessary skills to be employable
in the 21st century. Young people represent the future of a country’s economy.

Governments, therefore, would want to grow their economies by reaching as many youth as
possible. Youth focused non-profits might be looking to train youth and match them with
jobs that demand their specific skill-sets. Recruiting agencies seek to get paid for providing
job placement services. Employers may want to integrate backwards into the talent pipeline
to secure the right talent by running their own internal training and development programs.
For each of these types of organizations, running simple and cost-effective demand-driven
skills training programs can help them achieve their objectives. Since 2013, West Africa

Vocational Education (WAVE) has developed and refined a demand-driven skills training
program focused on teaching hard-working young people the skills required to secure
entry-level jobs in the services sectors and build brighter futures for themselves.

WAVE provides a model, which can be successfully implemented in part or in whole. WAVE
builds brighter futures for unemployed and underemployed youth in West Africa by
empowering them with the soft skills needed for employment and by creating a fairer, more
inclusive labor pool. WAVE began in Nigeria by turning undervalued talent into a reliable
pool of human capital for local businesses. WAVE influences employers’ attitudes and
provides access to employable youth from low-income backgrounds.

The WAVE model is a demand-driven training (DDT) model that empowers youth and
enables them seek and obtain employment opportunities. **The DDT is defined as skills
development initiatives that are customized to respond directly to the specific
requirements of a job role, for an employer or a group of employers, and lead to
placement in employment or self-employment.**

WAVE focuses on key skills such as effective communication (verbal, non-verbal, digital),
critical thinking, problem-solving, teamwork and self management (goal setting, time
management, managing expectations and emotional intelligence). WAVE also works with
employers and human resource professionals at multiple touch points (curriculum
development, instructional design, work-based experiential learning, and as off-takers for
full-time employment) to ensure their team is equipped with updated skills in-line with
current job requirements. The model also ensures skills remain evergreen through a
continuous education approach.
