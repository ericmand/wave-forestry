title: How to Use the Toolkit
---

The toolkit is designed to be non-prescriptive, recognizing that flexibility and innovation
drive improvement within each organization. It is intended to be a guide, which helps
organizations that want to replicate the WAVE model based on its driving principles.

Replicating organizations can identify what part of the WAVE model they wish to replicate
and go through the resources and tools to help guide their implementation process. Each
section is self contained, and provides an overview of the process (what), how it is
conducted at WAVE, why WAVE carries out the practices in the manner that it does
(principles), and tools that guide replicating organizations on how to implement each
process. Additional suggestions, tips and resources, which are closely aligned with WAVEâ€™s
work, are included. However, it is important to note that demand-driven training programs
align their training curriculum with the needs of an industry/sector; thus, a replicator that
seeks to be demand driven will likely need to use the toolkit in its entirety to be successful.
